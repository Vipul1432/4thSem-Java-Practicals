#Practical 2 : 

Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value x and y: 
1) 3.4x+50.2y=44.5 2) 2.1x+.55y=5.9 (Assume Cramer’s rule to solve equation 
ax + by = e                                      
x = ed – bf / ad - bc 
cx + dy = f                                      
y = af - ec / ad - bc)
